A puzzle game written in Ruby using the [Gosu Development Library](https://www.libgosu.org/). Based on classic puzzle games like its namesake, [Panel de Pon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpr9H_Zzhz8), players must create horizontal or vertical words to clear letter blocks before they reach the top of the screen.
