The [digital storefront](http://www.decadeleather.com) of my boutique luxury leather goods brand, Decade. The Decade webstore features a complete database, cart and checkout system and was coded using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [Devise](https://rubygems.org/gems/devise/versions/4.2.0), the [PayPal REST API](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/), and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) for content delivery. The store also features a [custom webapp](#) that allows users to build and purchase their own leather goods using Ruby, Javascript, and HTML5.
