I help set the tone and create the content that inspires members of the worldâ€™s largest service club organization--Lions Clubs International. In support of a three year service initiative culminating in the centennial celebration in 2017, I created a five-part multimedia installment exploring the organization's history. 

Each installment explores a new aspect of the history of Lions Clubs International with rare historical photos, videos, and audio, and is translated into the 11 official LCI languages.
