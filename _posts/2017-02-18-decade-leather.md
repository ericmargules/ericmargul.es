The [digital storefront](http://www.decadeleather.com) of the boutique luxury leather goods brand, Decade. The Decade webstore features a complete database, cart and checkout system, and was coded using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [Devise](https://rubygems.org/gems/devise/versions/4.2.0), and the [PayPal REST API](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/). The Decade storefront was deployed with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), and uses [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) for content delivery. 
<br/><br/>
The store also features a [custom webapp](https://ericmargules.github.io/code/2017/02/17/decade-leather-builder.html) that enables users to build and purchase their own leather goods using Ruby, Javascript, and HTML5.
